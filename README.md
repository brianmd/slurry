All project dependencies have been removed from this project, meaning this library cannot be run or tested on its own.
This allows adding of just the dependencies you need.
For example, no need to include oracle, neo4j, or datomic if you don't use those applications.
See https://github.com/brianmd/slurry-test.git for dependency versions that have been tested.

Also note that code in src/clj-and-s is used in both clojure and clojurescript. Please modify your source paths to include this directory should you use one of these libraries.
